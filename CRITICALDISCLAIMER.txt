Welcome to the CastledsContent repository!

Before you do anything here, please read this file in it's entirety:

- I am somewhat inexperienced to GitHub so if you see anything strange, it's most likely my  fault.

- When you commit a change to this repo, precisely describe what you did in the message; it will make identifying and, if needed, fixing the new additions much easier

- If you are changing something important, please mention me prior to the file update.

All of these are subject to change.
