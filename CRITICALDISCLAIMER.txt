Since I did not know how to upload files properly when I did upload them, PLEASE ignore the following folders & files which have been added in the following commits:

1. 2) Items Upload

2. Third Files Upload

Unless you know how to delete folders without a complicated procedure, we do not have any way of deleting these folders easily. 
However, if you do manage to delete the files added from these two commits, then you would have made navigating this repository 10x easier!

WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD ALL OF THE CODE FROM THIS REPOSITORY, PLEASE DELETE ALL FOLDERS THAT ARE DUPLIACTES THAT ARE FROM THE ITEMS FOLDER, AND DELETE ALL DUPLICATE ITEM FILES WHICH ARE NOT IN THE ITEMS FOLDER, BUT OUTSIDE OF IT.
