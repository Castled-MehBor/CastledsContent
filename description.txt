Welcome to Castled's Content, a mod which was once my personal playground for testing the quirks of modding, is now turning into a full-on content mod!


- [c/aaee21: 40+ new items!]

- 3 new bosses:
> Nasha and Grakos
> Corrupt Guardians
> Crimtane Prisoners

1 new "event"

* D E A T H (Requires Calamity Mod)
Use the Forbidden Beans item to summon it.

I also have a QOL mod called Castled's Token Addon. Check it out!
