Current Major Update: Feathers & Metal
Current Feature Update: Blissful Blizzards

Castled's Equilibrium is a passion project that started two years ago, which was to create a content mod with abstract elements.

Current Contents:
- A handful of items (including weapons, accessories and armor)
- Three Bosses; Flayke, Nasha & Grakos, and the Harpy Queen
- Superintendent: An item-based lottery minigame where you put your inventory at stake for a possible fortune.
- Vanity Presets: A vanity helper that helps to save and provide quick access to modifying the looks of your character,
allowing you to save up to five presets, and give names to each of them.
- The Tarr; a ravenous, rainbow hued sludgeball from the Far, Far Range, that will ignore nearly any attempt of harming it, while eat everything in it's way, replicating itself until it conquers the world...

(Feature Update) Blissful Blizzards:
- Added a new boss called Flayke; the first boss that I put an unreasonable amount of effort into (even the drops!)
- Added three new melee weapons (credit to Callie and Lamb sauce for creating them)
- Fixed certain bugs that stuck out sorely (Appendage of Her Highness, Enchanted Strap-bag)
- Added recipes for variations of the Fart in a Balloon

New Laptop change (Test Update)
This isn't meant to add or fix many things, if any at all. I'm just testing the new laptop to see if it can debug properly.
- Fixed an issue where the Permatrator was colliding into tiles if firing upwards while standing on a tile
