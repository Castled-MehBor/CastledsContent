Thank you all for 15K+ Downloads! It's unbelievable to see how many people have downloaded my mods. 
I hope to be able to create higher quality content in the future.

- [c/aaee21: 40+ new items!]

- 3 new bosses:
> Nasha and Grakos
> Corrupt Guardians
> Crimtane Prisoners

1 new "event"

* D E A T H (Requires Calamity Mod)
Use the Forbidden Beans item to summon it.

I also have a QOL mod called Castled's Token Addon. Check it out!
